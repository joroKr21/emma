    "# Transversers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes part of [Emma](https://github.com/emmalanguage/emma)'s compiler API. Transversers (short for transformers + traversers) are focused on manipulating Scala trees and Emma IR trees. Transformers change the tree while traversers only collect information about it. For all intents and purposes, both are equivalent (we can see traversal as the identity transformation). The only practical difference is efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist if this API is avoiding explicit recursion and mutable state by defining rules that operate on one node (and optionally some attributes) at a time. Each rule is usually one `case` in a partial function (also referred to as \"Matcher\") that returns substitute nodes or attributes and is passed to second-order combinators that specify the overall recursion strategy."

    "The transform / traverse API features six fundamental recursion strategies characterized in two orthogonal dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vertical direction:\n",
    "    - **Top-down**: traversal / transformation descend in a depth-first fashion from the root to the leaves;\n",
    "    - **Bottom-up**: traversal / transformation ascend recursively from the leaves to the root.\n",
    "2. After-match behaviour (what happens after a match at the current node):\n",
    "    - **Continue**: traversal / transformation continue to the next node in order;\n",
    "    - **Break**: traversal / transformation stop descending or ascending (NOTE: to stop ascending all children have to match);\n",
    "    - **Exhaust**: traversal / transformation iterate at the current node until a fix-point is found, then continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the above determines the direction and extent to which rules are applied. Theoretically, we can differentiate a third dimension - horizontal direction (left-to-right vs. right-to-left), but in practice we adopt a left-to-right policy.\n",
